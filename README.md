# Netflix-Clone
Here is a simple Netflix landing page clone using simple HTML, CSS and Javascript.

To use it, download all the files and folders given, and place them in a single folder and open the HTML file to see the results.

The window can even be resized, since the CSS code has the media queries for it.

These are some of the screenshots of the webpage :
